# Survival-prediction-of-lung-cancer-patients
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports cancer as the leading cause of death worldwide. Medical records, laboratory, and examination data, as well as questionnaires are continually conducted worldwide to assess and quantify the risk factors and reduce the impact of this global problem through early detection and early based prevention programs. Examining patterns in clinical analysis and finding correlations between symptoms and risk factors can help reduce the implications of lung cancer by avoiding the causes far before the detection of the disease.

In this project, we will use medical examination data that report mortality rates of lung cancer patients and build machine learning predictive models to predict the survival/mortality of patients one year after the thoracic surgery. The approach is to devise comparable machine learning algorithms and implement them in this medical application to predict post-operative life expectancy in lung-cancer patients. The topic described is a supervised learning task, more specifically, a classification problem with risk of mortality as a target variable. The target describes the risk of thoracic surgery on patients after a one-year timespan.

# Team Contribution
Manal Zneit – will implement the machine learning algorithms and build predictive models.

Sabina Bhuiyan – will design the visualization tool that will demo the comparisons of the models.

Both team members will implement evaluation techniques for model selection.

# Algorithms
The project described is a real-world problem - a classification task where we will implement several machine learning classifiers that predict the survival of patients. SVM, artificial neural network (perceptron), an instance-based learning model (K-Nearest Neighbors), and a probabilistic classifier (Naïve Bayes) will be implemented and compared accordingly. These models will be compared and evaluated using binary classifiers evaluation techniques.
